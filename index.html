            <p class="isi">Assalamualaikum, my name is Ratu Mutiara Pakungwati, You can call me Ratu or Lala.
                Great to see you! This is my first website that I make using CSS and HTML.
                I want to be a programmer, or developer, or whatever it's called, to be more professional.
                I believe with the help from tutors, the help from friends, and my own hard work, I can make it happen.

            <p class="isi">I graduated from Universitas Indonesia majoring in mathematics, focusing on actuarial -statistics.
                I was very excited to learn more about tecnology or digital  or analytical data practical in real life espesially for finance environtment.
                I love to learning something new and found that programming languages developed very quickly and were needed in various fields, 
                especially in the field of financial business and this was very interesting.
                I was very inspired by Mahatma Gandhi quotes

            </div>
            <p class="isi"> Once upon a time, there was a Queen (<em>that's me but I'm not a real queen</em>), I was very hungry,
                I went to the kitchen and saw freshly cooked greens (similar to spinach) in the pot, I took the rice and that greens,
                because I was in a hurry so I didn't read a prayer and immediately fed a spoonful of rice with the greens into my mouth,
                I just read a prayer after the food was already in my mouth, suddenly my mouth is tight! I can't keep chewing!
                I haven't had time to swallow the food then vomited that, after that my mouth felt a cramp, sore, and pain.
                A few seconds later my dad said these boiled greens <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taro">(taro leaves)</a>
                were a snack for <em>fish</em> don't eat it! &#128561 &#128557 &#128553.
                then my mom panicked and told me to go to the doctor.
